# Credit Card Form JavaScript

This is a JavaScript implementation of a credit card form with validation and formatting functionality. It provides a user-friendly interface for entering and validating credit card information, such as the cardholder's name, card number, expiration month and year, and CVV code.

## Features

- Automatic formatting of the credit card number with spaces every four digits for improved readability.
- Real-time validation of the input fields to ensure the entered information meets the required criteria.
- Display of error messages for invalid input fields, providing feedback to the user for correction.
- Submission of the form when all input fields are valid.

### The challenge

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
 - Any input field is empty
- The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page
